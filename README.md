# ALab-Leuven-Streamlit-App
Streamlit-based Dashboard companion of MIT Analytics Lab x Akkodis Project. The app interfaces with several large datasets stored in an AWS S3 bucket, and leverages KeplerGL API to display the geographical data with pretty maps. In this repo, "kepler_config" directory stores the config for kepler maps, app.py is the main code, while datasets.py handles AWS connections.

The app is hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud servers at:
